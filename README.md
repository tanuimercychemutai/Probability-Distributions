#Air Quality Data Analysis

##Introduction

The ability to determine which type of probability distribution best fits data, calculate z-scores, and detect outliers are essential skills in data analysis. These capabilities help data professionals understand how their data is distributed and identify anomalies that require further examination.

##Project Overview

In this project, you are part of an analytics team for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The dataset includes information on over 200 sites, identified by state, county, city, and local site names. One of the main goals is to determine which regions need support to make air quality improvements. Given that carbon monoxide (CO) is a major air pollutant, this analysis will focus on investigating data from the Air Quality Index (AQI) with respect to carbon monoxide levels.

##Objectives

*Identify the best-fitting probability distribution for the dataset.
*Compute z-scores for data points.
*Detect and analyze outliers in the dataset.
*Provide insights into regions that require support for air quality improvements.

##Dataset

The dataset contains:\
*Location Data: State, county, city, and site names.
*Air Quality Measurements: AQI values for carbon monoxide.
*Temporal Data: Time-stamped readings from monitoring stations.

##Technologies Used

*Python
*Pandas
*NumPy
*SciPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
